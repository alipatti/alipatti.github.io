- title: Polarization
  summary:
    # Political polarization is increasing, but the academic literature is
    # divided on whether or not this trend is affective (i.e.,
    # people don't like the other party) or ideological (i.e.,
    # people hold fundamentally different beliefs).
    In ongoing work, I provide evidence of rising ideological polarization in
    the American public, driven mostly by increases in disagreement
    within political parties.
    # rather than the divergence of opinions between Democrats and Republicans.
