\project{Ole or Carl?}{oleorcarl}

\begin{itemize}
	\item This project tests the validity of a long-standing stereotype that students from Northfield's two colleges look meaningfully different. If they are, then a machine learning model should be able to tell them apart? Right?
	\item Uses a SVM classifier on state-of-the-art vector embeddings of student's directory photos.
\end{itemize}

\project{Carleton Course Classifier}{course-classifier}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A Tensorflow natural-language model that predicts the department and course number of a course given its description. \item Achieves 64\% accuracy in a 54-class classification problem using a CNN and deep word embeddings.
	      %   TODO    
	      %  A human (me) gets about ??? percent.
\end{itemize}
