- title: Polarization
  summary:
    Interparty dislike is rising in the United States, but the literature is
    divided on whether this has been accompanied by a divergence in people's
    underlying ideology. In ongoing work, I propose a new measure of idological
    polarization in the American public and demonstrate its increase over the
    last several decades.

  summary:
    At Carleton, I studied a generalization of the set-cover problem where—in
    addition desirable "good" elements—the universe contains "bad" elements that
    one actively seeks to avoid.

  summary:
    In college, I helped develop a method for reporting abuse on messaging apps
    that still maintains the guarantees of end-to-end encryption. I devised a
    way for users to keep their privacy until their messages are reported many
    times or by many different people.
